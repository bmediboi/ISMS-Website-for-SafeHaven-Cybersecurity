# Security Incident Reports

The Security Incident Reports document provides guidelines for tracking, documenting, and analyzing security incidents within SafeHaven. Regular and detailed incident reporting allows the organization to identify trends, improve security measures, and comply with regulatory standards.

## Purpose

The purpose of Security Incident Reports is to maintain a structured approach to recording and reviewing all security incidents. These reports help SafeHaven:

- Evaluate the effectiveness of security measures
- Identify recurring vulnerabilities and areas for improvement
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements
- Maintain an accurate record of incident response activities

## Scope

This reporting process applies to all security incidents that impact SafeHaven’s information systems, data, or physical security. It covers:

- Cybersecurity incidents (e.g., data breaches, malware, phishing attacks)
- Physical security breaches
- Operational disruptions with potential security implications
- Any unauthorized access or attempted access to sensitive information

## Incident Reporting Process

### 1. Initial Incident Logging

When an incident is detected, it should be immediately logged with the following details:

- **Incident ID**: A unique identifier for tracking purposes
- **Date and Time of Incident**: When the incident was first detected
- **Incident Type**: Category of the incident (e.g., malware, data breach, unauthorized access)
- **Location**: Physical or virtual location affected by the incident
- **Detected By**: Name or ID of the employee, system, or tool that detected the incident

### 2. Incident Details and Description

Detailed information about the incident should be documented to provide a full picture of the event:

- **Description of Incident**: A narrative describing the incident, what was affected, and initial observations
- **Potential Impact**: Initial assessment of affected data, systems, or services
- **Affected Assets**: List of systems, devices, or data involved in the incident
- **Root Cause**: Known or suspected cause of the incident
- **Severity Level**: Classification of the incident’s impact (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical)

### 3. Response Actions

All actions taken in response to the incident should be recorded in real-time:

- **Containment Actions**: Steps taken to isolate or contain the incident
- **Eradication Efforts**: Specific actions to remove threats or vulnerabilities
- **Recovery Actions**: Actions taken to restore affected systems and services
- **Timeline of Actions**: Chronological list of actions taken from incident detection to resolution

---

## Incident Analysis

Each incident report should include an analysis of the incident to understand its implications and identify preventative measures:

- **Impact Assessment**: Detailed assessment of the incident’s impact on operations, data integrity, and security
- **Vulnerabilities Exposed**: Identification of any security weaknesses that contributed to the incident
- **Lessons Learned**: Insights gained from the incident, including what worked well and areas for improvement
- **Recommendations**: Suggested actions to prevent similar incidents in the future

## Metrics for Security Incident Reporting

SafeHaven uses the following metrics to evaluate incident management and response effectiveness:

| Metric                     | Description                                                                                 |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** | Average time taken to identify an incident from the moment it occurs                   |
| **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)** | Average time taken to respond and mitigate the incident after detection             |
| **Number of Incidents**       | Total count of security incidents over a specific period                               |
| **Incident Recurrence Rate**   | Frequency of similar incidents reoccurring, indicating potential recurring vulnerabilities |
| **Incident Severity Distribution** | Percentage of incidents categorized by severity level (e.g., Low, Medium, High) |

## Reporting and Review

### Monthly Incident Summary Report

Each month, a summary of security incidents should be prepared, highlighting:

- **Incident Count**: Total number of incidents
- **Trends**: Notable patterns or recurring incident types
- **Severity Levels**: Breakdown of incidents by severity
- **Resolution Time**: Average time taken for incident containment and resolution
- **Key Recommendations**: Suggested improvements or policy changes based on incident analysis

### Quarterly Incident Review

A quarterly review provides a more in-depth analysis, covering:

- **Top Incident Types**: Most common incident categories
- **High-Risk Incidents**: Incidents with critical impact or requiring major resources
- **Policy and Control Review**: Evaluation of current security controls and policies based on incidents
- **Training Needs**: Identification of training needs to improve incident response

### Annual Incident Report

The annual report is a comprehensive review of the year’s incidents, covering:

- **Annual Incident Summary**: Total incidents, trends, and key metrics for the year
- **Major Incidents**: Detailed case studies of significant incidents and organizational response
- **Security Posture Assessment**: Assessment of the effectiveness of security measures and recommendations for improvement
- **Compliance Review**: Ensuring incident handling practices meet regulatory requirements
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Long-term security improvements and resources required for incident management
