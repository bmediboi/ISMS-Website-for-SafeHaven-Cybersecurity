The objectives of this Incident Response Plan are to:

1. **Preparation**: Establish and maintain an effective incident response capability.
2. **Identification**: Rapidly detect and accurately identify information security incidents.
3. **Containment**: Limit the impact of incidents by preventing further spread or damage.
4. **Eradication**: Eliminate the root cause of the incident.
5. **Recovery**: Restore affected systems and services to normal operations.
6. **Lessons Learned**: Analyze incidents to improve future response and prevent recurrence.

## Policy Statements

1. **Incident Response Team (IRT)**: An Incident Response Team shall be established, comprising members from IT, Legal, HR, and Public Relations departments.
   
2. **Reporting Incidents**: All personnel must report suspected or confirmed security incidents immediately to the Incident Response Manager via the designated communication channels (e.g., incident@safehaven.com).

3. **Incident Classification**: Incidents shall be classified based on severity levels to prioritize response efforts.

4. **Communication Plan**: A clear communication strategy must be in place to inform stakeholders, including customers and regulatory bodies, as required.

5. **Documentation**: All actions taken during the incident response process must be thoroughly documented for legal, regulatory, and improvement purposes.

6. **Training and Awareness**: Regular training sessions shall be conducted to ensure all employees are aware of their roles and responsibilities in the event of an incident.

7. **Testing the Plan**: The Incident Response Plan must be tested at least annually through drills or simulations to ensure its effectiveness.

## Incident Response Phases

### 1. **Preparation**
- **Policies and Procedures**: Develop and maintain incident response policies and procedures.
- **Training**: Conduct regular training for the incident response team (IRT).
- **Tools and Resources**:
  - Maintain an updated inventory of hardware, software, and critical assets.
  - Deploy monitoring tools for real-time threat detection.

---

### 2. **Detection and Analysis**
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:
  - Unauthorized access attempts.
  - Unusual network traffic or activity.
  - Unexpected system changes or alerts from monitoring tools.
- **Analysis**:
  - Identify the scope and severity of the incident.
  - Gather and document evidence, including logs, screenshots, and error messages.

---

### 3. **Containment**
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate affected systems to prevent lateral movement.
  - Block malicious IPs, domains, or applications.
- **Strategies**:
  - **Short-term containment**: Disconnect impacted devices temporarily.
  - **Long-term containment**: Apply patches, change passwords, or rebuild systems if necessary.

---

### 4. **Eradication**
- **Identify Root Cause**:
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to pinpoint vulnerabilities exploited.
- **Eliminate Threat**:
  - Remove malware, unauthorized accounts, or compromised files.
- **Validate Systems**:
  - Perform vulnerability scans to ensure threats have been eradicated.

---

### 5. **Recovery**
- **Restore Systems**:
  - Reintegrate affected systems into the network.
  - Restore data from clean backups.
- **Testing**:
  - Validate the integrity and functionality of restored systems.
- **Monitor**:
