# Incident Response Plan

## Purpose
The purpose of this Incident Response Plan (IRP) is to ensure a structured and efficient approach to managing and mitigating cybersecurity incidents. The plan aims to minimize the impact on SafeHaven Cybersecurity’s operations, protect sensitive data, and restore normal business functions as quickly as possible.

---

## Objectives
1. Detect and respond to incidents promptly.
2. Contain and mitigate the effects of incidents.
3. Identify root causes and prevent future occurrences.
4. Ensure regulatory compliance and maintain stakeholder trust.

---

## Incident Response Phases

### 1. **Preparation**
- **Policies and Procedures**: Develop and maintain incident response policies and procedures.
- **Training**: Conduct regular training for the incident response team (IRT).
- **Tools and Resources**:
  - Maintain an updated inventory of hardware, software, and critical assets.
  - Deploy monitoring tools for real-time threat detection.

---

### 2. **Detection and Analysis**
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:
  - Unauthorized access attempts.
  - Unusual network traffic or activity.
  - Unexpected system changes or alerts from monitoring tools.
- **Analysis**:
  - Identify the scope and severity of the incident.
  - Gather and document evidence, including logs, screenshots, and error messages.

---

### 3. **Containment**
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate affected systems to prevent lateral movement.
  - Block malicious IPs, domains, or applications.
- **Strategies**:
  - **Short-term containment**: Disconnect impacted devices temporarily.
  - **Long-term containment**: Apply patches, change passwords, or rebuild systems if necessary.

---

### 4. **Eradication**
- **Identify Root Cause**:
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to pinpoint vulnerabilities exploited.
- **Eliminate Threat**:
  - Remove malware, unauthorized accounts, or compromised files.
- **Validate Systems**:
  - Perform vulnerability scans to ensure threats have been eradicated.

---

### 5. **Recovery**
- **Restore Systems**:
  - Reintegrate affected systems into the network.
  - Restore data from clean backups.
- **Testing**:
  - Validate the integrity and functionality of restored systems.
- **Monitor**:
  - Implement enhanced monitoring to detect any recurrence.

---

### 6. **Post-Incident Activities**
- **Documentation**:
  - Compile a detailed incident report, including timelines, actions taken, and outcomes.
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Conduct a post-mortem analysis with the incident response team.
  - Identify areas for improvement and update the response plan accordingly.
- **Preventive Measures**:
  - Apply patches and updates.
  - Enhance training and awareness programs.

| Role                       | Responsibility                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Incident Response Team** | Coordinate and execute the response plan.          |
| **System Administrators**  | Contain, mitigate, and restore affected systems.   |
| **Forensic Analysts**      | Investigate and document root causes.              |
| **Communications Team**    | Manage internal and external communications.       |
| **Executive Team**         | Approve critical decisions and allocate resources. |

---

## Communication Plan
- **Internal Notifications**:
  - Alert stakeholders and teams as soon as an incident is confirmed.
- **External Notifications**:
  - Notify affected customers and regulatory authorities if required.
  - Issue public statements to address potential reputational risks.
- **Channels**:
  - Use secure communication platforms (e.g., encrypted email, VPN).

---

## Metrics for Incident Response
- **Time to Detect**: Measure how quickly incidents are identified.
- **Time to Contain**: Track the time taken to isolate the threat.
- **Time to Recover**: Assess the duration required to restore operations.
- **Number of Incidents**: Monitor trends and frequency of security events.
- **Lessons Implemented**: Measure progress in applying post-incident improvements.

---

## Regulatory Compliance
This plan ensures compliance with the following standards:
- **ISO 27001**: Information Security Management Systems
- **NIST SP 800-61**: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation (if applicable)
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (if applicable)

---

## Review and Updates
- **Frequency**: The IRP should be reviewed **annually** or after significant changes in the organization’s infrastructure.
- **Update Process**: Assign a designated team to update the plan as new threats and technologies emerge.
