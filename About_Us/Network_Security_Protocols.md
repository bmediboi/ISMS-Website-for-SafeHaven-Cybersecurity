## Purpose
To establish comprehensive protocols that protect SafeHaven's network infrastructure from unauthorized access, disruptions, and potential cyber threats.

## Policy Scope
This policy applies to all internal and external networks, including wired, wireless, and cloud-based connections utilized by SafeHaven Cybersecurity.

## Ownership
- **Policy Owner**: Network Security Department
- **Manager**: Adam Brown

## Policy Objective
The objective of this policy is to:

1. Prevent unauthorized access to the organization's network.
2. Ensure continuous availability of network services.
3. Maintain compliance with relevant industry and regulatory standards.

## Policy Statements

1. **Access Control**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and least-privilege access must be enforced across all network endpoints.
2. **Firewall Configurations**: Network boundaries must be protected by firewalls configured to block unauthorized traffic.
3. **Network Segmentation**: Critical assets must be isolated using VLANs and other segmentation techniques.
4. **Encryption Standards**: All data transmitted over public networks must be encrypted using AES-256 or equivalent protocols.
5. **Threat Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring tools must be deployed to detect and mitigate potential threats.
6. **Wireless Security**: Corporate wireless networks must be secured using WPA3 encryption and regularly updated credentials.
7. **Incident Handling**: A predefined incident response procedure must be followed in case of any network breach.

## Core Network Security Protocols

### 1. **Firewall Management**
- **Implementation**:
  - Deploy firewalls at network entry points to monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic.
  - Enforce rules to allow only authorized traffic based on organizational needs.
- **Maintenance**:
  - Conduct regular rule reviews and updates.
  - Enable logging to detect unauthorized access attempts.

---

### 2. **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**
- **Usage**:
  - Secure remote connections for employees accessing the corporate network.
- **Encryption**:
  - Implement strong encryption protocols (e.g., IPsec, OpenVPN) to protect data in transit.
- **Authentication**:
  - Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for VPN access.

---

### 3. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)**
- **Functionality**:
  - Monitor network traffic for malicious activities or policy violations.
  - Block or quarantine suspicious traffic in real-time.
- **Types**:
  - **Host-Based IDPS (HIDPS)**: Protects individual devices.
  - **Network-Based IDPS (NIDPS)**: Monitors traffic across the entire network.

---

### 4. **Access Control**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Grant network access based on user roles and responsibilities.
  - Enforce the principle of least privilege to minimize risks.
- **Network Segmentation**:
  - Separate critical systems from general access areas to reduce the attack surface.

---

### 5. **Secure Configuration**
- **Best Practices**:
  - Disable unused ports and services.
  - Regularly update and patch network devices, including routers, switches, and access points.
- **Configuration Backups**:
  - Maintain secure backups of network device configurations for quick recovery in case of failures.

---

### 6. **Wireless Network Security**
- **Encryption**:
  - Use WPA3 for secure wireless communications.
- **Authentication**:
  - Enforce strong passwords and WPA2/3-Enterprise for enhanced security.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Regularly audit wireless networks to detect rogue access points and unauthorized devices.

---

### 7. **Monitoring and Logging**
- **Network Monitoring**:
  - Use network monitoring tools (e.g., Wireshark, Nagios) to identify performance and security issues.
- **Centralized Logging**:
  - Implement centralized logging for all network devices to facilitate incident response and audits.
- **Log Retention**:
  - Retain logs for a predefined period to comply with regulatory requirements.

---

## Incident Response for Network Security
1. **Detection**:
   - Use IDPS and monitoring tools to identify potential threats.
2. **Containment**:
   - Isolate affected systems and block malicious IPs.
3. **Eradication**:
   - Remove malware, close vulnerabilities, and update network devices.
4. **Recovery**:
   - Restore normal operations and monitor for recurring issues.

---

## Regulatory Compliance
- **ISO 27001**: Information Security Management Systems
- **NIST SP 800-53**: Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation (if applicable)
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (if applicable)

---

## Metrics for Evaluation
- **Blocked Intrusions**: Number of attempted intrusions blocked by firewalls and IDPS.
- **Vulnerability Scan Results**: Number of vulnerabilities identified and remediated.
- **Network Downtime**: Measure of availability and reliability of network systems.
- **Incident Response Time**: Time taken to detect, contain, and resolve network incidents.

---

## Maintenance and Review
1. **Frequency**:
   - Conduct periodic reviews of network security protocols every six months.
2. **Updates**:
   - Revise protocols in response to emerging threats and organizational changes.
3. **Testing**:
   - Perform routine penetration tests to identify and address weaknesses.
