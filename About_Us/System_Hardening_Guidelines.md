# System Hardening Guidelines

## Purpose
The purpose of these guidelines is to establish a secure baseline configuration for all systems within SafeHaven Cybersecurity's infrastructure. System hardening reduces vulnerabilities, minimizes the attack surface, and enhances the overall security posture of the organization.

## What is System Hardening?
System hardening refers to the process of:
- **Removing unnecessary components** such as services, applications, and user accounts.
- **Configuring systems** to comply with security best practices.
- **Applying updates** and patches to address vulnerabilities.

## Key Areas of System Hardening

### 1. **Operating System Hardening**
- **Update and Patch Management**:
  - Regularly apply security patches and updates.
  - Automate updates where possible, with testing before deployment.
- **Remove Unnecessary Services**:
  - Disable unused services to minimize attack vectors.
  - Examples: Telnet, FTP, SNMP.
- **Restrict Administrative Access**:
  - Implement the principle of least privilege for administrative accounts.
  - Use role-based access control (RBAC).

### 2. **Application Hardening**
- **Install Necessary Applications Only**:
  - Remove bloatware or trial software.
- **Enable Application Whitelisting**:
  - Allow only approved applications to execute.
- **Secure Application Configurations**:
  - Disable default accounts and passwords.
  - Enforce strong encryption protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher).

### 3. **Network Hardening**
- **Firewall Configuration**:
  - Block all incoming traffic by default and allow only necessary traffic.
  - Use a layered firewall strategy (host-based and network-based).
- **Disable Unused Ports**:
  - Perform regular port scans to identify and close unused ports.
- **Secure Protocols**:
  - Replace insecure protocols (e.g., HTTP, Telnet) with secure alternatives (e.g., HTTPS, SSH).

### 4. **Account Hardening**
- **Password Policies**:
  - Enforce strong passwords with complexity and expiration policies.
  - Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all privileged accounts.
- **Account Auditing**:
  - Regularly review accounts for inactive or unauthorized users.
  - Disable or remove unused accounts promptly.

### 5. **Device Hardening**
- **Endpoint Security**:
  - Deploy endpoint protection solutions, including antivirus and anti-malware.
- **Encrypt Data Storage**:
  - Enable full-disk encryption for all devices.
- **Secure BIOS/UEFI**:
  - Set strong BIOS/UEFI passwords and disable booting from external devices.

## General Best Practices

### 1. **Enable Logging and Monitoring**
- Use centralized logging solutions to detect anomalies.
- Enable audit logs for system activities.

### 2. **Secure Remote Access**
- Restrict remote access to essential personnel.
- Use VPNs or Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) for secure connectivity.
- Disable remote desktop services (RDP) unless absolutely necessary.

### 3. **Backup and Recovery**
- Implement regular, automated backups.
- Test recovery processes to ensure data can be restored in case of failure.

### 4. **Configuration Management**
- Document and version-control all system configurations.
- Use automated tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to enforce secure configurations.

### 5. **Periodic Penetration Testing**
- Conduct penetration tests to identify weaknesses in hardened systems.
- Address vulnerabilities promptly.

## Compliance Requirements
The system hardening process aligns with key industry standards and frameworks:
- **ISO 27001**: Information Security Management Systems
- **NIST SP 800-53**: Security and Privacy Controls
- **PCI-DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**:
  - Oversee system hardening processes.
  - Conduct regular security assessments.
- **System Administrators**:
  - Implement hardening guidelines for assigned systems.
  - Monitor compliance with hardening policies.
- **Auditors**:
  - Verify adherence to system hardening guidelines.

---

## Review and Maintenance
- **Frequency**: Hardening guidelines should be reviewed **annually** or after any significant infrastructure changes.
- **Updates**: New guidelines should be developed as emerging threats are identified.
