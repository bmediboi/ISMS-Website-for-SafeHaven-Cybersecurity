# Data Protection Policy

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure the secure handling, storage, and transmission of sensitive data, safeguarding it against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors.
- All systems, networks, and applications that process or store sensitive data.

## Objectives
1. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Protect data from unauthorized modifications.
2. **Maintain Data Confidentiality**: Restrict data access to authorized personnel only.
3. **Guarantee Data Availability**: Ensure data is accessible when needed for authorized use.

## Policy Guidelines
1. **Data Classification**:
   - All data must be classified as either Confidential, Sensitive, or Public.
   - The classification determines the level of protection required.

2. **Data Storage**:

   - Physical storage devices (e.g., USB drives) containing sensitive data must be locked when not in use.

3. **Access Control**:
   - Access to sensitive data must be granted on a need-to-know basis.
   - Role-based access controls (RBAC) should be implemented for all systems.

4. **Data Transmission**:
   - All sensitive data transmitted over networks must use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SFTP).
   - Data encryption must be applied during transmission.

5. **Data Retention and Disposal**:
   - Data should only be retained as long as it is necessary for business or legal requirements.
   - Secure methods (e.g., data shredding) must be used to dispose of sensitive data.

6. **Incident Response**:
   - Any data breach must be reported immediately to the IT security team.
   - An incident response plan should be executed to minimize impact and restore operations.

## Compliance and Monitoring
