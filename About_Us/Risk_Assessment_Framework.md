# Risk Assessment Framework

## Purpose
The purpose of this framework is to establish a standardized methodology for identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and mitigating risks to SafeHaven Cybersecurity's systems, processes, and operations. This ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical assets.

## Scope
This framework applies to:
- All IT systems, networks, applications, and data assets.
- All business processes and third-party interactions.
- Employees, contractors, and third-party vendors handling company assets.

## Objectives
1. **Identify Risks**: Proactively recognize potential risks to information security and business continuity.
2. **Evaluate Risks**: Assess the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
3. **Mitigate Risks**: Develop and implement controls to minimize or eliminate risks.
4. **Monitor and Review**: Continuously monitor and update risk assessments to reflect the changing threat landscape.

## Risk Assessment Process

### 1. Risk Identification
- **Asset Inventory**:
  - Identify all critical assets, including systems, applications, and data.
- **Threat Identification**:
  - Identify potential threats such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, human errors, and technical failures.
- **Vulnerability Identification**:
  - Identify weaknesses that could be exploited by threats.

### 2. Risk Analysis
- Assess risks based on:
  - **Likelihood**: The probability of a risk event occurring.
  - **Impact**: The consequences of the risk event on assets and operations.
- Assign risk levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low) using a risk matrix.

| Likelihood → | High         | Medium      | Low         |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Impact ↓** |              |             |             |
| High         | Critical     | High Risk   | Medium Risk |
| Medium       | High Risk    | Medium Risk | Low Risk    |
| Low          | Medium Risk  | Low Risk    | Low Risk    |

---

### 3. Risk Evaluation
- Compare identified risks against the organization's risk tolerance.
- Prioritize risks based on their levels for mitigation.

---

### 4. Risk Treatment
Select one or more of the following approaches:
- **Accept**: Accept low-priority risks with minimal impact.
- **Mitigate**: Implement controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of risks.
- **Transfer**: Transfer risks through insurance or third-party agreements.
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the source of the risk by ceasing the associated activity.

#### Risk Mitigation Controls
- **Technical Controls**:
  - Firewalls, encryption, antivirus, and access control mechanisms.
- **Administrative Controls**:
  - Policies, training, and incident response plans.
- **Physical Controls**:
  - Security cameras, locks, and access badges.

---

### 5. Risk Monitoring and Review
- Continuously monitor risks and control effectiveness.
- Perform regular risk assessments to identify emerging threats.
- Update the Risk Register and Statement of Applicability (SoA) accordingly.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Risk Management Team**:
  - Lead the risk assessment process and implement controls.
- **Department Heads**:
  - Identify risks within their respective areas and report them to the Risk Management Team.
- **All Employees**:
  - Participate in training and report potential risks.

---

## Compliance
This framework complies with:
- ISO 27001: Information Security Management
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- HIPAA Security Rule
- PCI-DSS Compliance Standards

Non-compliance with this framework may result in disciplinary action.

---

## Review and Updates
This framework will be reviewed annually or whenever significant changes occur to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.
