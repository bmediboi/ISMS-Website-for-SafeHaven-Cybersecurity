# Change Management Policy

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a structured approach to managing changes within SafeHaven Cybersecurityâ€™s systems, processes, and operations to minimize risks and ensure business continuity.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- All changes to IT systems, infrastructure, and applications.
- Changes to business processes, workflows, and policies.
- All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors involved in the change process.

## Objectives
1. **Standardize Change Management**: Provide a structured approach for planning, approving, implementing, and monitoring changes.
2. **Minimize Risks**: Reduce the likelihood of errors, disruptions, and security breaches caused by changes.
3. **Enhance Communication**: Ensure all stakeholders are informed and involved in the change process.

## Policy Guidelines

### 1. Types of Changes
Changes are classified as:
- **Standard Changes**:
  - Routine, low-risk changes with pre-approval (e.g., scheduled system updates).
- **Normal Changes**:
  - Non-routine changes requiring approval through the Change Management process.
- **Emergency Changes**:
  - High-priority changes required to resolve critical incidents or security breaches.

### 2. Change Request Process
- **Initiate**:
  - Submit a Change Request Form detailing the change, its purpose, and potential risks.
- **Evaluate**:
  - Assess the change for its impact, risks, and feasibility.
- **Approve**:
  - Obtain approval from relevant stakeholders or the Change Advisory Board (CAB).
- **Plan**:
  - Develop an implementation plan, including rollback procedures.

### 3. Implementation
- Follow the approved implementation plan.
- Test changes in a controlled environment before deploying them to production.
- Monitor the change during and after implementation to ensure its success.

### 4. Post-Implementation Review
- Conduct a review to:
  - Evaluate the success of the change.
  - Identify lessons learned.
  - Update documentation to reflect the change.

### 5. Emergency Change Process
- Emergency changes must bypass the normal approval process but still require post-implementation review.
- Document the rationale, impact, and resolution for all emergency changes.

## Compliance and Review
