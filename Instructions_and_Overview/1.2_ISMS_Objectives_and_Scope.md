# ISMS Objectives and Scope

The SafeHaven Cybersecurity Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a structured, comprehensive framework of security measures designed to protect small businesses' digital assets, maintain compliance, and support overall resilience against cybersecurity threats.

## Objectives

- **Data Integrity Protection**: Ensure data remains accurate, complete, and protected from unauthorized modification. This involves implementing regular integrity checks, enforcing access controls, and using advanced monitoring tools to detect and respond to potential integrity threats.
- **Confidentiality Assurance**: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by applying stringent access controls, encryption, and role-based permissions, minimizing risks from both external threats and internal breaches.
- **Availability of Resources**: Guarantee that critical information is available when needed by implementing redundancy measures, failover mechanisms, and maintaining system uptime to support uninterrupted business operations.
- **Compliance with Industry Standards**: Align with major industry standards and regulations, including HIPAA, PCI-DSS, FFIEC, and SOC 2, to protect customer data and build trust. Regular audits and gap assessments will ensure SafeHaven's compliance and preparedness for certification renewals.
- **Incident Management and Response**: Develop and enforce incident response protocols that include threat detection, mitigation strategies, communication plans, and continuous improvement based on post-incident analysis.
