# Compliance Framework Introduction

SafeHaven Cybersecurity adheres to multiple industry standards to ensure the security, integrity, and compliance of our Information Security Management System (ISMS). These standards guide SafeHaven in implementing best practices to safeguard sensitive data and maintain regulatory compliance.

## Industry Standards

| Standard       | Description                                                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HIPAA**      | Ensures the protection of health information, requiring robust data privacy and security measures for all entities handling healthcare data. |
| **PCI-DSS**    | Maintains the security of card payment information through strict controls on data handling, storage, and transmission. |
| **FFIEC**      | Provides guidance for financial institutions to ensure the confidentiality and security of their financial data and operations. |
| **SOC 2**      | Focuses on the security, availability, confidentiality, processing integrity, and privacy of customer data for service organizations. |

## Compliance Practices

To uphold these standards, SafeHaven implements the following compliance practices across all operations:

- **Data Encryption**: Strong encryption techniques are employed to protect data both at rest and in transit, ensuring that sensitive information remains inaccessible to unauthorized entities.
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) limit access to critical information, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.
- **Regular Audits**: Annual internal and third-party audits assess our compliance with each standard. These audits include vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and compliance checks to identify and mitigate potential security gaps.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: SafeHaven employs real-time monitoring of its network, systems, and data transactions to detect anomalies and potential threats, allowing for rapid response to compliance risks.
- **Policy Review and Updates**: Compliance policies are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect any changes in regulations, technologies, or organizational requirements. This includes staying up-to-date with amendments to HIPAA, PCI-DSS, FFIEC, and SOC 2 standards.
- **Incident Response**: SafeHaven has a defined incident response plan to manage and report security incidents, ensuring any compliance-related breaches are resolved and documented swiftly to minimize impact.
