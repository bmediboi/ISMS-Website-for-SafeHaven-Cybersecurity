### Compliance Practices

- **Data Encryption**: We use strong encryption methods to protect data at rest and in transit.
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive information.
- **Regular Audits**: Internal and third-party audits are conducted annually to ensure compliance with each standard.

SafeHaven actively monitors updates to these standards to stay compliant and protect client information.
