# Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Compliance Framework

## Introduction
SafeHaven Cybersecurity maintains PCI DSS compliance to ensure secure handling of payment card data through comprehensive security controls, robust processes, and continuous monitoring. PCI DSS compliance is crucial to prevent data breaches and build customer trust.

## Requirements Implementation

### 1. Network Security Controls
- **Firewall Configuration**
  * **Network Segmentation**: Isolate cardholder data environments (CDEs) from other networks to minimize exposure.
  * **Rule Base Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation for all firewall rules, including purpose and justification.
  * **Change Management**: Implement strict change management processes to review and approve rule modifications.
  * **Regular Reviews**: Conduct quarterly reviews of firewall configurations to ensure compliance and relevance.

- **System Hardening**
  * **Baseline Configurations**: Apply secure baseline configurations to all systems handling payment data.
  * **Security Parameters**: Disable unnecessary services, protocols, and ports.
  * **Patch Management**: Regularly update systems with security patches to address vulnerabilities.
  * **Vulnerability Management**: Perform automated and manual scans to identify and mitigate system vulnerabilities.

### 2. Cardholder Data Protection
- **Data Storage Controls**
  * **Encryption Requirements**: Encrypt all stored cardholder data using AES-256 encryption or equivalent standards.
  * **Key Management**: Securely store and manage encryption keys with access limited to authorized personnel.
  * **Access Restrictions**: Enforce strict controls to limit access to cardholder data based on job roles.
  * **Data Inventory**: Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all data assets containing cardholder information.

- **Transmission Security**
  * **Encryption Protocols**: Use TLS 1.2 or higher for secure data transmission.
  * **Certificate Management**: Regularly renew and validate digital certificates to ensure authenticity.
  * **Secure Channels**: Implement VPNs or other secure channels for remote access to cardholder data.
  * **Monitoring Systems**: Deploy tools to monitor data transmission for anomalies and unauthorized access attempts.

### 3. Vulnerability Management
- **Security Testing**
  * **Vulnerability Scanning**: Perform internal and external scans quarterly and after significant system changes.
  * **Penetration Testing**: Conduct annual penetration testing to simulate real-world attack scenarios.
  * **Configuration Reviews**: Regularly review system configurations to ensure alignment with PCI DSS standards.
  * **Code Analysis**: Use static and dynamic code analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities in application code.

- **Patch Management**
  * **Patching Procedures**: Establish standardized patch management processes for all systems.
  * **Testing Requirements**: Test patches in a controlled environment before deployment.
  * **Emergency Patches**: Develop a process for prioritizing and applying critical patches.
  * **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of all patching activities, including timelines and outcomes.

### 4. Access Control Measures
- **Identity Management**
  * **Authentication Methods**: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing CDEs.
  * **Password Requirements**: Use strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity, expiration).
  * **Account Management**: Implement automated processes for creating, modifying, and deleting accounts.
  * **Privileged Access**: Limit administrative access to a small group of authorized personnel.

- **System Access**
  * **Access Request Workflow**: Define a formal process for requesting access to cardholder data systems.
  * **Approval Processes**: Require managerial and compliance team approvals for access requests.
  * **Regular Reviews**: Conduct quarterly reviews of access logs to identify and revoke unnecessary permissions.
  * **Termination Procedures**: Immediately revoke access for terminated or inactive employees.

---

### 5. Monitoring and Testing
- **Security Monitoring**
  * **Log Collection**: Aggregate logs from all systems accessing cardholder data using a centralized logging solution.
  * **Alert Management**: Set up automated alerts for unusual activity or potential security incidents.
  * **Incident Response**: Develop predefined workflows for responding to detected anomalies.
  * **Review Procedures**: Conduct daily or weekly reviews of logs and alert trends.

- **Testing Program**
  * **Control Testing**: Test security controls quarterly to verify their effectiveness.
  * **Security Assessments**: Engage third-party assessors to validate compliance with PCI DSS.
  * **Compliance Verification**: Use gap analysis tools to identify areas needing improvement.
  * **Gap Remediation**: Develop action plans to address gaps identified during assessments.

---

### 6. Security Policy Framework
- **Policy Requirements**
  * **Documentation Standards**: Maintain clear, concise documentation for all security policies.
  * **Review Frequency**: Update policies annually or after significant changes to the environment.
  * **Distribution Methods**: Ensure policies are accessible to all employees via a centralized repository.
  * **Training Requirements**: Provide mandatory training to ensure employees understand and adhere to policies.

- **Program Management**
  * **Roles and Responsibilities**: Assign specific roles for policy enforcement and compliance monitoring.
  * **Resource Allocation**: Ensure sufficient resources for maintaining and improving compliance efforts.
  * **Performance Metrics**: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of compliance programs.
  * **Continuous Improvement**: Use audit findings and incident reviews to refine policies and controls.

## Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review PCI DSS compliance to integrate new requirements and address emerging threats.
- Use feedback from audits, incidents, and performance metrics to continuously improve security measures.
