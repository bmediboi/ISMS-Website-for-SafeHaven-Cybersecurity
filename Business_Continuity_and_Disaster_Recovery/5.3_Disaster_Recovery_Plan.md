### **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)**

#### **1\. Purpose**

The purpose of the DRP is to outline the specific actions SafeHaven Cybersecurity will take to recover from disaster events, such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, and major system failures. The plan aims to minimize disruption, ensure timely restoration of key functions, and uphold regulatory compliance.

#### **2\. Objectives**

* Restore critical IT systems, data, and applications within established recovery time objectives (RTOs).  
* Minimize financial, reputational, and operational impact from disasters.  
* Ensure a coordinated response and recovery effort across teams.  
* Preserve customer trust and maintain service continuity.

#### **3\. Scope**

This DRP applies to all critical IT infrastructure, applications, and data managed by SafeHaven Cybersecurity. It addresses events that severely disrupt normal business operations, with a primary focus on IT recovery.

#### **4\. Disaster Recovery Teams and Roles**

* **Disaster Recovery Team (DRT):**  
  Responsible for leading and coordinating recovery efforts, monitoring disaster scenarios, and managing communication.  
* **IT and Infrastructure Team:**  
  Tasked with implementing the technical aspects of the DRP, including system backups, data recovery, and network restoration.  
* **Business Continuity Team (BCT):**  
  Works closely with the DRT to ensure non-technical aspects of recovery, such as remote work arrangements, client communications, and employee safety.  
* **Executive Management:**  
  Provides oversight, authorizes resource allocation, and communicates with external stakeholders when necessary.

#### **5\. Disaster Recovery Phases**

* **Preparation**  
  * Develop, document, and maintain a comprehensive disaster recovery plan.  
  * Train the DRT and all relevant personnel on their roles and responsibilities.  
  * Conduct regular simulations and tests of the DRP to ensure preparedness.  
* **Identification and Activation**  
  * Detect and assess the severity of the disaster, determining whether DRP activation is warranted.  
  * If the event qualifies as a disaster, activate the DRP and notify all relevant personnel and stakeholders.  
  * Implement initial containment measures (e.g., isolating affected systems) to prevent further damage.  
* **Recovery Procedures**  
  * **System Recovery**  
    * Prioritize and recover critical systems first, including server infrastructure, networks, and applications.  
    * Implement predefined procedures to restore servers, storage, and network connectivity in line with RTOs.  
  * **Data Restoration**  
    * Retrieve and restore data from the most recent backup, ensuring integrity checks are conducted.  
    * Recover databases, files, and application data necessary for essential business operations.  
  * **Application Recovery**  
    * Validate and restart critical applications, such as client management, cybersecurity monitoring, and reporting systems.  
    * Test functionality and verify that applications are operational and secure before returning them to service.  
* **Reconstitution**  
  * Gradually reintroduce non-critical systems and services as critical systems stabilize.  
  * Reassess and optimize systems for performance and security, applying any necessary patches or upgrades.

#### **6\. Disaster Recovery Site and Redundancy**

* **Primary and Secondary Data Centers:**  
  * Maintain a secondary data center or cloud-based recovery environment with redundant infrastructure, ensuring rapid failover capabilities.  
* **Offsite Backup Storage:**  
  * Utilize offsite or cloud-based backup storage to provide a reliable data source for recovery after a disaster.  
  * Ensure backups are stored in geographically separate locations to reduce vulnerability to localized disasters.  
* **Redundant Systems:**  
  * Implement redundant systems for critical applications and databases to facilitate faster recovery.  
  * Employ failover technologies, such as load balancers and high-availability clusters, for essential functions.

#### **7\. Communication Plan**

* **Internal Communications:**  
  * Notify relevant teams and stakeholders promptly upon DRP activation, providing clear updates on incident status, action plans, and recovery progress.  
  * Establish a central communication platform (e.g., dedicated Slack channels, SMS) for real-time updates.  
* **External Communications:**  
  * Communicate with clients, partners, and regulatory authorities as needed to maintain transparency and trust.  
  * Prepare pre-approved messaging templates to ensure timely, consistent updates.

#### **8\. Testing and Training**

* **Regular DRP Testing**  
  * Conduct annual DRP testing to validate recovery procedures, identify weaknesses, and ensure personnel readiness.  
  * Use scenarios such as cyberattacks, data corruption, and power outages to simulate disaster conditions.  
* **Team Training and Drills**  
  * Train DRT members regularly to reinforce familiarity with their roles.  
  * Review DRP procedures and protocols with all staff, ensuring awareness of emergency protocols.

#### **9\. Documentation and Maintenance**

* **Disaster Recovery Documentation:**  
  * Maintain comprehensive documentation of all disaster recovery procedures, contact information, recovery timelines, and incident logs.  
  * Ensure documentation is accessible to the DRT and securely backed up offsite.  
* **Plan Review and Updates:**  
  * Review and update the DRP at least annually, or whenever significant changes occur in the organizationâ€™s infrastructure or processes.  
  * Incorporate lessons learned from testing and real disaster incidents to enhance the DRP
