# Emergency Communication Plan

The Emergency Communication Plan provides a structured approach to ensure that all SafeHaven stakeholders are informed and prepared to respond effectively in case of a business disruption or disaster. This plan ensures clear, consistent, and timely communication to minimize impact and maintain business continuity.

## Purpose

The purpose of this Emergency Communication Plan is to define communication protocols and establish guidelines for notifying internal and external stakeholders during an emergency or disaster. It aims to ensure transparency, manage information flow, and reduce confusion while supporting recovery efforts.

## Scope

This plan applies to all SafeHaven employees, departments, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders involved in or affected by an emergency or business disruption. The communication protocols outlined in this plan apply to incidents such as:

- Natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods)
- Cybersecurity incidents (e.g., data breaches, ransomware)
- Physical security breaches
- Power outages or infrastructure failures
- Other disruptions impacting operations

## Communication Phases

### 1. Pre-Incident Preparation

**Preparedness is key to ensuring effective communication during an emergency.** Key steps include:
- **Contact List Management**: Maintain up-to-date contact lists for employees, clients, vendors, regulatory bodies, and emergency contacts.
- **Communication Channels**: Establish and test all communication channels, including email, SMS alerts, phone trees, and collaboration platforms.
- **Training and Awareness**: Conduct regular training for employees and departments on the Emergency Communication Plan.

### 2. Incident Notification

Upon identifying a potential or confirmed emergency, initiate the notification process to communicate the situation to stakeholders promptly.

#### Notification Triggers
- Identified natural disaster affecting operations
- Critical infrastructure failure or power outage
- Confirmed cybersecurity incident or data breach
- Incident leading to physical or environmental hazard

#### Notification Steps
1. **Initial Alert**: Incident Response Team or designated personnel initiates the first notification to stakeholders.
2. **Confirm Incident**: Ensure the incident's nature, scale, and impact are confirmed before broad notification.
3. **Prioritize Communication**: Notify critical stakeholders (executive team, IT, legal, and compliance) first, then all employees and external parties.
