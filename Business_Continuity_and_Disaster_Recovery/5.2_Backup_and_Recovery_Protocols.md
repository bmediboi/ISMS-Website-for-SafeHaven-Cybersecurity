### **Backup and Recovery Protocols**

#### **1\. Purpose**

The purpose of these protocols is to establish a systematic approach for backing up data, ensuring data integrity, and enabling swift recovery. The protocols aim to minimize downtime, prevent data loss, and support business continuity.

#### **2\. Objectives**

* Ensure regular, secure backups of all critical data and configurations.  
* Maintain offsite or cloud-based storage to safeguard backups from physical damage or cybersecurity incidents.  
* Enable rapid data recovery and system restoration within acceptable timeframes (aligned with RTOs and RPOs).

#### **3\. Types of Backups**

* **Full Backup:**  
  * Complete backup of all data and systems, performed at least once a month.  
  * Forms the foundation of the backup strategy, ensuring a complete set of data is always available for restoration.  
* **Incremental Backup:**  
  * Backs up only the data that has changed since the last backup (either full or incremental).  
  * Performed daily to reduce backup time and storage space requirements.  
* **Differential Backup:**  
  * Backs up data that has changed since the last full backup.  
  * Used weekly to provide faster recovery than incremental backups, by consolidating data changes.

#### **4\. Backup Storage and Retention**

* **Primary Storage:**  
  * Backup copies are stored in a secure, onsite storage system with restricted access.  
  * Enables quick restoration of recent data in case of minor disruptions.  
* **Offsite/Cloud Storage:**  
  * Regular backups (weekly full and daily incremental backups) are stored in a secure offsite or cloud-based repository.  
  * Provides a geographically dispersed backup in case of physical or site-specific incidents, such as natural disasters.  
* **Retention Policy:**  
  * **Daily Backups:** Retained for 30 days.  
  * **Weekly Backups:** Retained for 6 months.  
  * **Monthly Backups:** Retained for 1 year.  
  * All backups are securely deleted after the retention period expires to ensure data privacy and regulatory compliance.

#### **5\. Data Encryption and Security**

* **Encryption:**  
  * All backup data is encrypted using strong encryption standards (e.g., AES-256) before transmission and while stored to prevent unauthorized access.  
* **Access Control:**  
  * Strict access control measures are in place to limit backup and recovery access to authorized personnel only.  
  * Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access controls (RBAC) are enforced.  
* **Integrity Checks:**  
  * Regular integrity checks (e.g., checksums) are conducted on backups to ensure data hasnâ€™t been corrupted or tampered with.

#### **6\. Recovery Process**

* **Step 1: Assess Impact and Identify Requirements**  
  * Determine the extent of data loss or corruption and identify which backup version will be needed for restoration.  
* **Step 2: Initiate Recovery**  
  * Authorized personnel initiate the recovery process, selecting the appropriate backup (based on RPO and RTO requirements) from onsite or offsite storage.  
  * Recovery operations are logged to ensure traceability.  
* **Step 3: Data Verification and Validation**  
  * Once data is restored, verify its integrity to ensure all files are complete and uncorrupted.  
  * Run validation tests on critical applications and data to confirm functionality before returning systems to normal operation.  
* **Step 4: System and User Notification**  
  * Once recovery is complete, notify relevant teams, including IT and affected users, that systems are operational.  
  * Communicate any necessary changes, updates, or further actions required to maintain continuity.

#### **7\. Testing and Maintenance**

* **Testing**  
  * Conduct regular recovery drills (at least quarterly) to ensure the backup process and systems function correctly, identify potential issues, and train the IT team in emergency procedures.  
  * Test data restoration from both onsite and offsite storage to verify that the backup protocol meets the expected recovery objectives.  
* **Maintenance**  
  * Regularly review and update backup schedules, retention policies, and storage solutions to adapt to changing data volumes, infrastructure, or compliance requirements.  
  * Perform updates on backup software, hardware, and security protocols to keep them current.

#### **8\. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **IT and Data Management Team:**  
  * Responsible for scheduling, performing, and monitoring backups, as well as for executing recovery procedures when necessary.  
* **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Team:**  
  * Oversees the overall backup and recovery strategy, coordinates with IT on testing, and ensures compliance with backup protocols.  
* **Management:**  
  * Provides oversight and authorizes updates to the backup and recovery plan based on evolving organizational needs or regulatory changes.
