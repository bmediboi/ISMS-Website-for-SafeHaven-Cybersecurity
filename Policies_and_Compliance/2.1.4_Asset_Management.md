## Asset Register
The asset register is a centralized record of all assets and is updated regularly. It includes details such as asset classification, location, ownership, and security measures.

### Asset Classification
Assets are categorized into three sensitivity levels:
1. **Confidential**: Highly sensitive assets (e.g., financial data, customer records).
2. **Internal Use Only**: Assets restricted to internal operations.
3. **Public**: Non-sensitive assets accessible externally.

### Sample Asset Details
| Asset ID | Description                | Classification | Location    | Owner      | Security Measures         |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------|

## Asset Management Process

### 1. Asset Identification
Each asset is assigned a unique identifier (Asset ID) and entered into the asset register. The identifier is used for tracking the asset throughout its lifecycle.

### 2. Asset Ownership
- **Asset Owners**: Every asset is assigned to an owner responsible for its security, usage, and compliance.
- **Departmental Responsibility**: Departments such as IT, Finance, and HR manage their respective assets.

### 3. Asset Classification
Assets are classified based on:
- **Sensitivity**: Level of confidentiality required.
- **Compliance**: Regulatory standards affecting the asset.
- **Operational Impact**: Importance to organizational processes.

### 4. Asset Inventory and Tracking
The asset register is reviewed quarterly and updated for changes in asset status, location, or ownership.
