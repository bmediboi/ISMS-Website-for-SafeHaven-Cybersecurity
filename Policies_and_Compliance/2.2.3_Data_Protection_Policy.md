# Data Protection Policy

SafeHaven Cybersecurity is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. This Data Protection Policy outlines the measures taken to secure data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for protecting sensitive data processed, stored, and transmitted by SafeHaven. This policy ensures that data protection controls are applied consistently across the organization, minimizing risks and supporting compliance with regulations such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and SOC 2.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who access, process, or handle sensitive data on behalf of SafeHaven Cybersecurity. It covers all data types, including but not limited to:

- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
- **Payment Card Information (PCI)**
- **Protected Health Information (PHI)**
- **Confidential business data**

## Data Protection Principles

SafeHaven Cybersecurity adheres to the following data protection principles to ensure the security and privacy of sensitive data:

1. **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**: Data is collected and processed in a manner that is lawful, fair, and transparent to individuals.
2. **Data Minimization**: Data collection is limited to what is necessary for specific purposes, avoiding unnecessary storage of excessive information.
3. **Accuracy**: Data is maintained accurately and kept up to date. Inaccuracies are corrected or deleted as necessary.
4. **Storage Limitation**: Data is only retained for as long as necessary and securely disposed of once it is no longer needed.
5. **Integrity and Confidentiality**: Data is protected against unauthorized access and processing through appropriate security measures.

## Data Protection Measures

### 1. Data Encryption

- **Data at Rest**: Sensitive data is encrypted when stored on servers, databases, and devices.
- **Data in Transit**: All data transmitted over networks is encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) to prevent interception and unauthorized access.

### 2. Access Control

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access to data is restricted based on roles and responsibilities, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA is enforced for accessing critical systems and data repositories to enhance security.

### 3. Data Classification

Data is classified into different categories based on sensitivity and regulatory requirements. The classification system includes:

- **Public**: Data intended for public release.
- **Internal**: Data accessible to employees but not for public sharing.
- **Confidential**: Data accessible to select individuals within SafeHaven.
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive data requiring special handling and limited access.

### 4. Data Retention and Disposal

- **Retention Periods**: Data is retained for a specified period based on legal, regulatory, and business requirements. After the retention period, data is securely disposed of.
- **Secure Disposal**: Data no longer needed is destroyed through secure methods, such as data wiping or physical destruction of media.

### 5. Monitoring and Logging

- **Data Access Logs**: Access to sensitive data is logged and monitored regularly to detect unauthorized access attempts.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Systems are in place to detect and respond to unusual activities that may indicate potential security incidents.
