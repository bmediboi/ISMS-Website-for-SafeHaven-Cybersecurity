# Policy Change Management

Effective policy change management is critical to ensuring SafeHaven Cybersecurity's Information Security Management System (ISMS) remains compliant, relevant, and responsive to emerging threats and regulatory updates. This document outlines the processes for implementing, approving, and communicating changes to ISMS policies.

## Purpose

The purpose of this Policy Change Management process is to establish a structured approach for evaluating, approving, and implementing changes to ISMS policies. This ensures all policy modifications support SafeHaven’s security objectives, align with regulatory requirements, and address new or evolving risks.

## Scope

This Policy Change Management document applies to all ISMS policies and covers the following:

- **Change Initiation**: Identifying the need for changes based on regulatory updates, internal audits, risk assessments, and feedback from employees or management.
- **Review and Approval**: A formal review and approval process to ensure that changes align with ISMS objectives.
- **Implementation**: Ensuring updated policies are effectively implemented across the organization.
- **Communication and Training**: Notifying relevant personnel of policy changes and updating training materials as necessary.
- **Ongoing Monitoring and Evaluation**: Regular review of policies to ensure they remain effective and appropriate for the organization’s needs.

## Policy Change Management Procedures

### 1. Change Initiation

Policy changes can be initiated by:

- **Regulatory Requirements**: When there are updates to industry standards such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, or FFIEC, policies must be reviewed and updated accordingly.
- **Audit Findings**: Internal or external audit findings may identify areas where policy changes are necessary to enhance compliance and security.
- **Risk Assessments**: New risks identified during assessments may require policy modifications to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Employee Feedback**: Employees can submit suggestions for policy improvements through the ISMS feedback channel.

### 2. Review and Approval

Once a change request is initiated, it undergoes a review and approval process:

- **Initial Review**: The ISMS Manager and Compliance Officer conduct an initial assessment of the proposed change, evaluating its potential impact on existing policies and ISMS objectives.
- **Approval Process**: The proposed change is presented to executive management for final approval. High-impact changes may require input from external advisors or legal counsel.
- **Document Control**: Approved changes are documented in the ISMS Change Log, including details of the change, the date of approval, and the individuals involved in the review process.

### 3. Implementation

After approval, policy changes are implemented as follows:

- **Update Documentation**: All affected policies and related documents are revised to reflect the approved changes.
- **System and Process Updates**: IT Support Staff make necessary updates to systems or processes to support the new policy requirements.
- **Compliance Checks**: The Compliance Officer verifies that all changes have been correctly implemented and align with regulatory standards.

### 4. Communication and Training

Effective communication ensures that all relevant personnel are informed of policy changes:

- **Notifications**: Employees are notified of significant policy updates via email, newsletters, and the ISMS portal.
- **Training**: Training materials are updated to reflect policy changes, and mandatory training sessions are conducted if the changes impact day-to-day operations.
- **Documentation**: Updated policies are made accessible in the ISMS Documentation repository for reference.

### 5. Monitoring and Evaluation

To ensure the ongoing effectiveness of policy changes:

- **Periodic Audits**: Policies are periodically audited to verify adherence to the updated requirements.
- **Feedback Collection**: Employees are encouraged to provide feedback on the implementation and effectiveness of the updated policies.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Insights from monitoring activities, audits, and feedback are used to drive continuous improvements in policy management.

- **Effective Date**: The date when the change takes effect.
- **Version History**: A log of previous versions, detailing each modification to maintain an audit trail.
