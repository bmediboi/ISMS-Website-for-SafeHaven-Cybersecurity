## Policy Objective
The objectives of this Risk Management Policy are:
1. To identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks systematically.
2. To ensure compliance with applicable regulatory standards and requirements.
3. To maintain a comprehensive Risk Register to monitor and document risks.
4. To establish a proactive approach to risk management across the organization.

---

## Risk Management Principles
SafeHaven’s approach to risk management is based on the following principles:
- **Proactive Identification**: Identify risks before they lead to incidents.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Assess both the likelihood and impact of risks.
- **Timely Mitigation**: Implement appropriate mitigation actions based on risk priority.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitor and review risks to adapt to changes.

---

## Risk Management Process

### 1. Risk Identification
- **Objective**: Identify potential risks across SafeHaven’s information systems, processes, and external relationships.
- **Process**:
  - Conduct risk assessments at least annually or after major operational changes.
  - Use interviews, surveys, and reviews to identify risks from employees and stakeholders.
  - Document each identified risk in the **Risk Register** with a unique ID, description, and affected assets.

---

### 2. Risk Analysis
- **Objective**: Assess each identified risk to determine its potential impact and likelihood.
- **Process**:
  - Apply qualitative and quantitative approaches to evaluate the risk’s impact on SafeHaven’s operations.
  - Classify risks based on severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
  - Document analysis results in the **Risk Register**.

---

### 3. Risk Evaluation
- **Objective**: Compare each assessed risk against SafeHaven’s risk tolerance and determine the need for action.
- **Process**:
  - Evaluate whether each risk falls within SafeHaven’s acceptable risk levels.
  - Escalate risks exceeding tolerance thresholds to senior management.
  - Prioritize risks based on their impact and likelihood for mitigation planning.

---

### 4. Risk Treatment
- **Objective**: Implement appropriate measures to mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid each risk.
- **Treatment Options**:
  - **Mitigate**: Apply controls to reduce the risk’s impact or likelihood.
  - **Transfer**: Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance).
  - **Accept**: Monitor risks that fall within SafeHaven’s risk tolerance.
  - **Avoid**: Eliminate activities that introduce unacceptable risks.

---

### 5. Monitoring and Review
- **Objective**: Track risk status and evaluate control effectiveness over time.
- **Process**:
  - Perform regular reviews of risks and mitigation measures, updating the Risk Register as needed.
  - Conduct an annual review of SafeHaven’s risk management practices.
  - Adjust controls and treatment plans based on changes in SafeHaven’s risk landscape.

---

## Risk Register
SafeHaven maintains a centralized **Risk Register** to document and track risks, including:
- **Risk ID**: Unique identifier.
- **Description**: Summary of the risk.
- **Severity**: Classification (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- **Likelihood**: Probability of occurrence.
- **Mitigation Actions**: Planned or completed actions.
- **Status**: Current status (e.g., open, in progress, mitigated).
