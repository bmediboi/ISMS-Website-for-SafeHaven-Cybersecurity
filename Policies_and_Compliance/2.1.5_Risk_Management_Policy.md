## 1. Overview

The Risk Management Policy establishes SafeHaven's structured approach to identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks that may impact its information security, regulatory compliance, and operational stability. This policy ensures that risks are managed in a consistent, systematic, and proactive manner.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to provide SafeHaven with a framework for managing risks associated with information assets, operational processes, and regulatory compliance. By following this policy, SafeHaven aims to minimize potential harm and support the continuous, secure operation of its systems.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all departments, employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who interact with SafeHaven’s information systems and resources. It encompasses:
- **Information Security Risks**: Risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
- **Operational Risks**: Risks that may disrupt SafeHaven’s ability to deliver services.
- **Compliance Risks**: Risks associated with non-compliance with regulatory requirements, such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and SOC 2 standards.

## 4. Risk Management Principles

SafeHaven’s approach to risk management is based on the following principles:
- **Proactive Identification**: Identify risks before they lead to incidents.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Assess both the likelihood and impact of risks.
- **Timely Mitigation**: Implement appropriate mitigation actions based on risk priority.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitor and review risks to adapt to changes.

## 5. Risk Management Process

SafeHaven’s risk management process involves five key steps: Identification, Analysis, Evaluation, Treatment, and Monitoring.

### 5.1 Risk Identification
- **Objective**: Identify potential risks across SafeHaven’s information systems, processes, and external relationships.
- **Process**:
  - Conduct risk assessments at least annually or after major operational changes.
  - Use interviews, surveys, and reviews to identify risks from employees and stakeholders.
  - Document each identified risk in the **Risk Register** with a unique ID, description, and affected assets.

### 5.2 Risk Analysis
- **Objective**: Assess each identified risk to determine its potential impact and likelihood.
- **Process**:
  - Apply a qualitative or quantitative approach to evaluate the risk’s impact on SafeHaven’s operations.
  - Classify each risk based on severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) considering its potential effect on SafeHaven’s objectives.
  - Document analysis results in the **Risk Register**.

### 5.3 Risk Evaluation
- **Objective**: Compare each assessed risk against SafeHaven’s risk tolerance and determine the need for action.
- **Process**:
  - Evaluate whether each risk falls within SafeHaven’s acceptable risk levels.
  - Escalate risks that exceed tolerance thresholds to senior management.
  - Prioritize risks based on impact and likelihood for efficient mitigation planning.

### 5.4 Risk Treatment
- **Objective**: Implement appropriate measures to mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid each risk.
- **Treatment Options**:
  - **Mitigate**: Apply controls to reduce the risk's impact or likelihood (e.g., firewalls, encryption).
  - **Transfer**: Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance).
  - **Accept**: Accept risks that fall within SafeHaven’s risk tolerance, monitoring them periodically.
  - **Avoid**: Eliminate activities that introduce unacceptable risk.
- **Documentation**: Record treatment actions in the **Risk Register**, including responsible personnel and status.

### 5.5 Monitoring and Review
- **Objective**: Track risk status and evaluate control effectiveness over time.
- **Process**:
  - Perform regular reviews of risks and mitigation measures, updating the Risk Register as needed.
  - Conduct an annual review of SafeHaven’s risk management practices.
  - Adjust controls and treatment plans based on changes in SafeHaven’s risk landscape.

## 6. Risk Register

SafeHaven maintains a **Risk Register** to document and track risks, including:
- **Risk ID**: Unique identifier.
- **Description**: Summary of the risk.
- **Severity**: Classification (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- **Likelihood**: Probability of occurrence.
- **Mitigation Actions**: Planned or completed actions.
- **Status**: Current status (e.g., open, in progress, mitigated).

The Risk Register is updated quarterly and after any major changes to SafeHaven’s operational or technological landscape.
