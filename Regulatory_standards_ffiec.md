# Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) Compliance Framework

## Introduction
SafeHaven Cybersecurity implements FFIEC guidelines to ensure robust security controls for financial institution services and data protection. 
The FFIEC framework is essential for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical financial data.

## Framework Components

### 1. Information Security Program
- **Risk Management**
  * **Risk Assessment Methodology**: Conduct regular risk assessments using a standardized methodology to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats.
  * **Control Selection**: Implement appropriate technical, administrative, and physical controls to mitigate identified risks.
  * **Risk Monitoring**: Continuously monitor risk levels using automated tools and manual reviews.
  * **Reporting Requirements**: Provide quarterly risk reports to senior management and stakeholders.

- **Security Operations**
  * **Security Monitoring**: Deploy a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution to collect and analyze security logs in real time.
  * **Incident Response**: Develop a detailed playbook for responding to security incidents, ensuring minimal impact on operations.
  * **Change Management**: Enforce strict change management policies to track and approve system updates.
  * **Configuration Control**: Regularly review system configurations to ensure alignment with FFIEC guidelines.

### 2. Authentication and Access
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  * **Authentication Methods**: Use a combination of knowledge, possession, and inherence factors (e.g., passwords, tokens, biometrics).
  * **Risk-Based Implementation**: Apply MFA selectively based on user roles and access risk levels.
  * **Fallback Procedures**: Define recovery methods for users unable to complete authentication (e.g., helpdesk verification).
  * **Monitoring Requirements**: Audit MFA usage and investigate anomalies regularly.

- **Access Management**
  * **Authorization Processes**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to critical systems and data.
  * **Role Management**: Regularly review and update user roles to reflect current job responsibilities.
  * **Review Procedures**: Conduct biannual reviews of access rights and permissions.
  * **Audit Requirements**: Maintain detailed logs of all access attempts for compliance audits.

### 3. Vendor Management
- **Due Diligence**
  * **Assessment Procedures**: Conduct thorough security assessments of vendors before onboarding.
  * **Risk Rating**: Assign risk levels to vendors based on the criticality of their services and data access.
  * **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly evaluate vendor performance against defined service levels and compliance obligations.
  * **Issue Management**: Document and address compliance gaps identified during assessments.

- **Contract Management**
  * **Security Requirements**: Include explicit security requirements in all vendor contracts.
  * **Service Levels**: Define clear service level agreements (SLAs) to ensure accountability.
  * **Compliance Obligations**: Specify regulatory compliance requirements and monitoring practices.
  * **Review Procedures**: Update contracts periodically to reflect changing compliance needs.

### 4. Business Continuity
- **Continuity Planning**
  * **Business Impact Analysis**: Conduct annual analyses to identify critical processes and dependencies.
  * **Recovery Strategies**: Develop detailed recovery plans for restoring operations after disruptions.
  * **Testing Requirements**: Test continuity plans at least annually to ensure effectiveness.
  * **Documentation Standards**: Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation of all continuity plans.

- **Incident Response**
  * **Response Procedures**: Establish predefined workflows for responding to various incident scenarios.
  * **Communication Plans**: Define protocols for notifying stakeholders during incidents.
  * **Recovery Steps**: Include detailed steps for recovering from incidents while minimizing downtime.
  * **Post-Incident Review**: Conduct reviews after incidents to identify lessons learned and update procedures.

### 5. Audit and Compliance
- **Audit Program**
  * **Testing Schedule**: Maintain a rolling schedule of internal and external audits to validate compliance.
  * **Evidence Collection**: Collect documentation demonstrating the effectiveness of controls.
  * **Finding Remediation**: Address audit findings promptly and document corrective actions.
  * **Reporting Requirements**: Provide detailed audit reports to senior leadership and regulatory bodies.

- **Compliance Management**
  * **Control Monitoring**: Use dashboards and metrics to track the effectiveness of implemented controls.
  * **Issue Tracking**: Maintain a centralized system for tracking and resolving compliance issues.
  * **Performance Metrics**: Regularly review metrics to assess compliance program effectiveness.
  * **Program Updates**: Update compliance programs to align with changes in FFIEC guidelines.
