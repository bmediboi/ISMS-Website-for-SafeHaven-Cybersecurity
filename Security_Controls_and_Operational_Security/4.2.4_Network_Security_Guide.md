# SafeHaven Network Security Guide

## Enterprise Network Security Standards & Best Practices

---

### 1. Network Architecture

#### Network Segmentation
- Implement defense in depth
- Separate networks by function:
  - Production Network
  - Development Network
  - Management Network
  - Guest Network
  - IoT Network
  - Security Systems Network
  - Backup Network
- Use physical or logical separation
- Implement micro-segmentation where appropriate

#### DMZ Configuration
- Place public-facing services in DMZ
- Multiple DMZ tiers for different risk levels
- No direct access from DMZ to internal network
- Implement reverse proxy services
- Separate partner connectivity DMZ

---

### 2. Access Control

#### Network Access Control (NAC)
- Implement 802.1X authentication
- Deploy RADIUS/TACACS+
- Configure port security
- MAC address filtering
- Role-based access control
- Network admission control

#### Remote Access
VPN Requirements:
- Split tunneling configuration
- Multi-factor authentication
- Strong encryption (AES-256)
- Perfect Forward Secrecy
- Certificate-based authentication
- Session timeouts

---

### 3. Security Controls

#### Perimeter Security
- Next-Generation Firewalls
- IDS/IPS systems
- Web Application Firewalls
- DDoS protection
- Email security gateway
- Advanced threat protection

#### Network Services Security
Secure configurations for:
- DNS (DNSSEC, DNS filtering)
- DHCP (snooping, authentication)
- NTP (authenticated time sources)
- SNMP (v3 only, restricted access)
- Active Directory (secured LDAP)

---

### 4. Network Protocols

#### Secure Protocol Implementation
- Disable legacy protocols:
  - SSLv2/v3
  - TLS 1.0/1.1
  - Telnet
  - FTP
  - SNMPv1/v2
  - RIPv1
- Enable secure protocols:
  - TLS 1.2/1.3
  - SSHv2
  - SNMPv3
  - SFTP
  - HTTPS

#### Routing Security
- Implement route authentication
- Use secure routing protocols
- Configure route filtering
- Enable BCP38/RFC2827 filtering
- Deploy RPKI validation
- Monitor BGP announcements

---

### 5. Wireless Security

#### WLAN Configuration
- WPA3-Enterprise deployment
- Separate SSIDs by purpose
- MAC address filtering
- Rogue AP detection
- Wireless IDS/IPS
- Guest network isolation

#### Wireless Best Practices
Required Settings:
- Disable WPS
- Enable PMF
- Strong pre-shared keys
- Hidden SSIDs for critical networks
- Rate limiting
- Client isolation

---

### 6. Monitoring & Detection

#### Network Monitoring
- Deploy network monitoring tools
- Configure NetFlow/sFlow
- Enable SNMP monitoring
- Implement packet capture
- Network performance monitoring
- Bandwidth monitoring

#### Security Monitoring
Monitor for:
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Protocol anomalies
- Failed access attempts
- Configuration changes
- System errors
- Performance issues

---

### 7. Logging & Analysis

#### Log Collection
- Central log management
- Log retention policy
- Secure log transmission
- Time synchronization
- Log integrity verification
- Regular log review

#### SIEM Integration
Configure logging for:
- Network devices
- Security appliances
- Critical servers
- Authentication systems
- Applications
- Infrastructure services

---

### 8. Incident Response

#### Network Containment
1. Identify affected segments
2. Implement emergency ACLs
3. Enable enhanced logging
4. Collect network evidence
5. Document incidents
6. Review security controls

#### DDoS Mitigation
Response Steps:
1. Traffic analysis
2. Enable blackhole routing
3. Activate scrubbing services
4. Contact upstream providers
5. Implement rate limiting
6. Monitor effectiveness

---

### 9. Regular Maintenance

#### Daily Tasks
- Review security alerts
- Monitor system health
- Check critical services
- Verify backups
- Update threat feeds

#### Weekly Tasks
1. Security patches
2. Configuration backups
3. Performance review
4. Capacity planning
5. Threat hunting
6. Policy compliance check

#### Monthly Tasks
- Network security audit
- Architecture review
- Policy updates
- Documentation review
- Training updates
- Vendor review

---

### 10. Network Documentation
