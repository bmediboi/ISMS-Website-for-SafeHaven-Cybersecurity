# Incident Response Plan

SafeHaven Cybersecurity is committed to a structured and swift response to security incidents to minimize impact, protect assets, and restore normal operations. This Incident Response Plan (IRP) outlines the procedures, roles, and responsibilities essential for managing security incidents effectively.

## Purpose

The purpose of this Incident Response Plan is to provide a clear framework for identifying, managing, and resolving security incidents that could potentially compromise SafeHavenâ€™s information systems, data integrity, and client trust. This IRP helps ensure a consistent approach to incident handling, supports regulatory compliance, and improves overall resilience against cyber threats.

## Scope

This plan applies to all SafeHaven employees, contractors, and third parties with access to our information systems. It covers the identification, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and review of security incidents affecting:

- Information Systems (e.g., servers, databases, applications)
- Data (e.g., customer information, financial data, PII)
- Infrastructure (e.g., network, physical security)
- Business Continuity

## Incident Response Phases

### 1. Preparation
SafeHaven takes proactive measures to ensure readiness for incident response, including:

- **Training and Awareness**: Regular training for employees and contractors on identifying and reporting security incidents.
- **Incident Response Team (IRT)**: A dedicated team responsible for coordinating response actions.
- **Tools and Resources**: Security tools, forensic tools, and communication channels to support incident response.
- **Documentation**: Clear guidelines on roles, responsibilities, and escalation processes.

---

### 2. Identification

The identification phase involves detecting and confirming potential security incidents. This phase includes:

- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Continuous monitoring of systems and networks using SIEM, IDS/IPS, and endpoint protection tools.
- **Incident Detection Sources**:
  - System logs and alerts
  - User reports
  - Vulnerability scans
  - Third-party notifications
- **Incident Classification**:
  - **Low**: Minor security incidents, non-critical issues.
  - **Medium**: Moderate issues, such as minor data exposure or suspicious activity.
  - **High**: Major issues, like data breaches, ransomware, and unauthorized access.
  - **Critical**: Severe issues with immediate impact on operations or sensitive data loss.

---

### 3. Containment

Once an incident is confirmed, containment actions are implemented to prevent further spread or damage:

- **Short-term Containment**: Immediate actions to isolate the incident, such as disconnecting affected systems from the network.
- **Long-term Containment**: Actions to enable ongoing monitoring and resolution, including installing security patches, and configuring firewalls.
- **Containment Strategies**:
  - Network isolation
  - Account suspension
  - Firewall rule adjustments
  - Enhanced logging and monitoring

---

### 4. Eradication

In the eradication phase, root causes of the incident are identified, and corrective measures are taken to remove malicious elements from systems:

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify how the incident occurred, including any vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
- **Elimination Actions**:
  - Malware removal
  - System reimaging or restoration
  - Patching vulnerabilities
  - Resetting compromised credentials
- **Verification**: Confirm that all traces of malicious activity have been removed and that affected systems are secure.

---

### 5. Recovery

The recovery phase ensures that systems and operations are restored to normal functionality:

- **System Restoration**: Reconnect cleaned systems to the network and restore regular operations.
- **Testing and Validation**: Ensure affected systems function properly and verify that vulnerabilities have been addressed.
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to detect any signs of residual threats or vulnerabilities.
- **Notification**: Inform affected users, clients, and stakeholders once systems are restored and secure.

---

### 6. Lessons Learned

Following the resolution of the incident, a review is conducted to identify areas for improvement:

- **Incident Review Meeting**: The Incident Response Team and relevant stakeholders meet to discuss the incident timeline, actions taken, and lessons learned.
- **Documentation**: All findings, including root causes, response actions, and impact, are documented for future reference.
- **Action Items**:
  - Update security policies and controls
  - Implement new safeguards as needed
  - Conduct additional employee training
- **Report Generation**: Generate a comprehensive report detailing the incident and improvements for management review.
