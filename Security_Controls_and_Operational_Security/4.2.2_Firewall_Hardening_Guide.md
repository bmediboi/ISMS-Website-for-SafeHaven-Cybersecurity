# SafeHaven Firewall Hardening Guide
## Enterprise Firewall Security Best Practices

### 1. Base Configuration
#### Default Policies
- Set default policies to "deny-all"
  - Inbound: DENY
  - Outbound: DENY
  - Forward: DENY
- Implement explicit allow rules only
- Log all denied traffic

#### Management Interface
- Restrict management access to dedicated management VLAN
- Use secure protocols (SSH, HTTPS, SNMPv3)
- Disable unused management interfaces
- Change default ports for management services
- Implement strong authentication

### 2. Critical Security Rules
#### Ingress Filtering
```text
# Priority order - implement from top to bottom
1. Block known malicious IPs/ranges
2. Allow established/related connections
3. Allow specific required services (examples):
   - TCP/443 (HTTPS)
   - TCP/80 (HTTP) - redirect to HTTPS
   - TCP/25 (SMTP) - to mail servers only
   - TCP/53, UDP/53 (DNS) - to DNS servers only
4. Drop and log everything else
```

#### Egress Filtering
```text
# Priority order - implement from top to bottom
1. Block known malicious domains/IPs
2. Allow established/related connections
3. Allow specific outbound services:
   - TCP/443 (HTTPS)
   - TCP/80 (HTTP)
   - TCP/53, UDP/53 (DNS)
   - NTP to approved timeservers
4. Drop and log everything else
```

### 3. Network Segmentation
#### VLAN Configuration
- Separate networks by function:
  - Production
  - Development
  - Management
  - Guest
  - IoT devices
- Implement inter-VLAN routing controls
- Use private RFC1918 addressing

#### DMZ Configuration
- Place public-facing servers in DMZ
- No direct access from DMZ to internal network
- Implement reverse proxy for web services
- Separate DMZ for partner connections

### 4. Advanced Security Features
#### Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
- Enable application-layer filtering
- Implement SSL/TLS inspection
- Configure IDS/IPS features
- Enable antivirus scanning

#### DoS Protection
- Enable anti-spoofing
- Configure connection rate limiting
- Implement SYN flood protection
- Set up ICMP filtering

### 5. VPN Configuration
#### Site-to-Site VPN
- Use IPsec with strong encryption
- Implement Perfect Forward Secrecy
- Use pre-shared keys or certificates
- Enable dead peer detection

#### Remote Access VPN
- Implement 2FA/MFA
- Use strong encryption protocols
- Configure split tunneling based on policy
- Set idle timeout values

### 6. Monitoring and Logging
#### Log Configuration
- Enable logging for:
  - Configuration changes
  - Authentication attempts
  - Denied traffic
  - System events
- Configure log rotation
- Set up remote logging (Syslog)

#### Alerts
```text
Configure alerts for:
- Configuration changes
- Multiple authentication failures
- High traffic volumes
- Signature matches
- Hardware failures
- License status
```

### 7. Regular Maintenance
#### Daily Tasks
- Review critical alerts
- Monitor system resources
- Check VPN status
- Verify rule effectiveness

#### Weekly Tasks
- Review log summaries
- Update threat intelligence feeds
- Check for firmware updates
- Verify backup configs

#### Monthly Tasks
- Rule base audit
- Performance review
- Security policy review
- Update documentation

### 8. Rule Base Management
#### Best Practices
- Document all rules
- Use descriptive names
- Include expiration dates for temporary rules
- Remove redundant rules
- Order rules for optimal performance

#### Sample Rule Documentation
```text
Rule Name: ALLOW_HTTPS_WEBSERVER
Source: ANY
Destination: WEB_SERVER_POOL
Service: HTTPS
Action: ALLOW
Purpose: Allow inbound HTTPS traffic to web servers
Owner: Web Team
Expiry: PERMANENT
Last Review: 2024-03-15
```

### 9. Emergency Response
#### Common Scenarios
- DDoS Attack Response
  1. Enable traffic sampling
  2. Implement blackhole routing
  3. Contact upstream providers
  4. Enable additional DDoS protections

- Breach Response
  1. Enable emergency rules
  2. Isolate affected segments
  3. Increase logging
  4. Contact security team

### 10. Compliance Requirements
- Document all changes
- Maintain rule justification
- Perform regular audits
- Keep configuration backups
- Maintain incident records
