# SafeHaven Firewall Hardening Guide  
## Enterprise Firewall Security Best Practices

---

### 1. Base Configuration  
#### Default Policies
- Set default action to **deny-all**:
  - **Inbound**: DENY
  - **Outbound**: DENY
  - **Forward**: DENY
- Implement only explicit allow rules and log all denied traffic.

#### Management Interface  
- Restrict access to a dedicated management VLAN.
- Enforce secure protocols (SSH, HTTPS, SNMPv3).
- Disable unused management interfaces and change default management ports.
- Apply strong, multi-factor authentication.

---

### 2. Critical Security Rules  
#### Ingress Filtering  
- Implement rules in the following priority:
  1. Block known malicious IPs and ranges.
  2. Allow only established or related connections.
  3. Permit required services only, e.g.:
      - **HTTPS** (TCP/443)
      - **HTTP** (TCP/80), redirect to HTTPS
      - **SMTP** (TCP/25) - limit to mail servers
      - **DNS** (TCP/53, UDP/53) - limit to DNS servers
  4. Drop and log all remaining traffic.

#### Egress Filtering  
- Use priority order for rules:
  1. Block access to known malicious domains and IPs.
  2. Allow only established or related connections.
  3. Permit outbound access for specific services, e.g.:
      - **HTTPS** (TCP/443)
      - **HTTP** (TCP/80)
      - **DNS** (TCP/53, UDP/53)
      - **NTP** (to approved time servers)
  4. Drop and log all other traffic.

### 3. Network Segmentation  
#### VLAN Configuration  
- Segment networks by function:
  - **Production**, **Development**, **Management**, **Guest**, **IoT**.
- Control inter-VLAN traffic and use private RFC1918 IP addresses.

#### DMZ Configuration  
- Place public-facing servers in the DMZ with no direct access to internal networks.
- Use a reverse proxy for web services and a separate DMZ for partner connections.

---

### 4. Advanced Security Features  
#### Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)  
- Enable application-layer filtering with SSL/TLS inspection.
- Activate IDS/IPS features and antivirus scanning.

#### DoS Protection  
- Configure anti-spoofing, rate limiting, SYN flood, and ICMP filtering to prevent Denial-of-Service attacks.

---

### 5. VPN Configuration  
#### Site-to-Site VPN  
- Enforce IPsec with strong encryption and Perfect Forward Secrecy.
- Use pre-shared keys or certificates and enable dead peer detection.

#### Remote Access VPN  
- Use strong encryption protocols and implement 2FA/MFA.
- Apply policy-based split tunneling and idle timeout values.

---

### 6. Monitoring and Logging  
#### Log Configuration  
- Enable logging for:
  - Configuration changes, authentication attempts, denied traffic, system events.
- Configure log rotation and remote logging to a centralized server.

#### Alerts  
- Set up alerts for key events:
  - Configuration changes, multiple failed logins, high traffic, IDS/IPS alerts, hardware issues, and license expiration.

---

### 7. Regular Maintenance  
#### Daily Tasks  
- Review critical alerts, monitor system health, check VPN status, and verify rule effectiveness.

#### Weekly Tasks  
- Review logs, update threat intelligence, check firmware updates, and verify backup configurations.

#### Monthly Tasks  
- Audit rule base, review performance, update security policy, and maintain documentation.

---

### 8. Rule Base Management  
#### Best Practices  
- Document all firewall rules with descriptive names, purposes, owners, and expiration dates for temporary rules.
- Regularly review and remove redundant rules; prioritize rule order for optimal performance.

#### Sample Rule Documentation  

- **Rule Name**: ALLOW_HTTPS_WEBSERVER  
- **Source**: ANY  
- **Destination**: WEB_SERVER_POOL  
- **Service**: HTTPS  
- **Action**: ALLOW  
- **Purpose**: Permit inbound HTTPS traffic to web servers  
- **Owner**: Web Team  
- **Expiration**: PERMANENT  
- **Last Review**: 2024-03-15

### 9. Emergency Response  
#### Common Scenarios  

- **DDoS Attack**  
  1. Enable traffic sampling and blackhole routing.
  2. Coordinate with upstream providers and implement advanced protections.
  
- **Breach Response**  
  1. Apply emergency isolation rules.
  2. Increase logging and isolate affected segments.
  3. Alert the security team immediately.

---

### 10. Compliance Requirements  
- Document all changes, justify rule purpose, perform regular audits, maintain configuration backups, and record all incidents.
