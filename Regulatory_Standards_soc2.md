# Service Organization Control 2 Compliance (SOC 2) Framework

## Introduction
SafeHaven Cybersecurity maintains SOC 2 compliance across all five Trust Services Criteria (TSC): Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy. Comprehensive controls, continuous monitoring, and regular assessments ensure compliance and safeguard customer trust.

## Trust Services Implementation

### 1. Security
- **Infrastructure Protection**
  * **Network Security**: Implement firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and endpoint protection to secure network boundaries.
  * **System Hardening**: Apply secure configurations to all systems and regularly update them to minimize vulnerabilities.
  * **Vulnerability Management**: Conduct periodic vulnerability scans and address identified issues promptly.
  * **Change Control**: Use a formal change management process to evaluate and approve system updates.

- **Security Operations**
  * **Monitoring Procedures**: Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution for real-time monitoring of threats.
  * **Incident Response**: Maintain a detailed playbook for handling security incidents, including escalation paths and containment measures.
  * **Investigation Requirements**: Document all incidents thoroughly, including root cause analysis.
  * **Remediation Processes**: Implement corrective actions to prevent incident recurrence.

### 2. Availability
- **System Operations**
  * **Performance Monitoring**: Use performance dashboards to track system uptime and identify bottlenecks.
  * **Capacity Management**: Regularly evaluate system capacity to handle peak loads.
  * **Maintenance Procedures**: Schedule preventive maintenance for critical systems to reduce downtime.
  * **Backup Requirements**: Perform daily backups and store them in geographically diverse locations.

- **Business Continuity**
  * **Recovery Planning**: Develop and test disaster recovery plans annually.
  * **Failover Testing**: Simulate failover scenarios to validate redundancy and recovery mechanisms.
  * **Communication Procedures**: Define protocols for notifying stakeholders during disruptions.
  * **Service Restoration**: Establish recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) for critical systems.

### 3. Processing Integrity
- **Data Processing**
  * **Input Validation**: Use automated checks to validate data inputs for completeness and accuracy.
  * **Processing Verification**: Conduct regular audits of processing workflows to ensure reliability.
  * **Output Quality**: Review output data for accuracy and integrity before distribution.
  * **Error Handling**: Develop procedures for identifying and resolving processing errors promptly.

- **Quality Control**
  * **Monitoring Procedures**: Implement monitoring tools to track processing performance and anomalies.
  * **Performance Metrics**: Define key metrics to measure the reliability and efficiency of processing systems.
  * **Issue Resolution**: Maintain an issue tracking system to log and address problems.
  * **Improvement Processes**: Use root cause analysis and corrective actions to enhance processing reliability.

### 4. Confidentiality
- **Data Protection**
  * **Classification Schema**: Assign sensitivity levels to all data (e.g., public, confidential, restricted).
  * **Handling Requirements**: Define protocols for handling data based on its classification.
  * **Access Controls**: Enforce role-based access controls and audit access logs regularly.
  * **Disposal Procedures**: Implement secure methods for disposing of confidential data, such as shredding or certified data wiping.

- **Information Lifecycle**
  * **Collection Controls**: Ensure that data collection processes align with defined business purposes.
  * **Usage Restrictions**: Limit data usage to approved activities only.
  * **Retention Requirements**: Define and enforce data retention periods for each classification.
  * **Destruction Standards**: Use certified tools and methods for secure data destruction.

### 5. Privacy
- **Privacy Program**
  * **Notice Requirements**: Inform individuals about data collection practices through clear privacy notices.
  * **Choice and Consent**: Provide options for users to consent to or opt out of data processing activities.
  * **Access and Correction**: Allow individuals to review, update, or delete their personal data upon request.
  * **Privacy Controls**: Use tools like data masking and anonymization to protect individual privacy.

- **Data Management**
  * **Collection Limitations**: Collect only the data necessary for business operations.
  * **Use Restrictions**: Enforce policies to prevent unauthorized data usage.
  * **Disclosure Controls**: Limit data sharing to authorized third parties with documented agreements.
  * **Individual Rights**: Respond to user requests for data access, correction, or deletion within regulatory timelines.

## Control Environment

### 1. Governance and Risk
- **Program Management**
  * Define roles and responsibilities for SOC 2 compliance, including control owners and reviewers.
  * Allocate sufficient resources (personnel, tools, and budget) for compliance activities.
  * Monitor the effectiveness of compliance programs through dashboards and regular updates.
  * Update compliance programs annually or as regulatory requirements change.

- **Risk Management**
  * **Assessment Methodology**: Use a structured framework to identify and assess risks to the organization.
  * **Control Selection**: Choose appropriate controls to mitigate identified risks.
  * **Monitoring Requirements**: Conduct continuous monitoring of key risk indicators.
  * **Reporting Procedures**: Provide regular risk reports to senior management and stakeholders.

### 2. Control Activities
- **Control Implementation**
  * **Control Objectives**: Define specific goals for each control, aligned with SOC 2 criteria.
  * **Control Activities**: Implement processes and tools to achieve control objectives.
  * **Testing Requirements**: Conduct periodic testing of controls to validate their effectiveness.
  * **Evidence Collection**: Maintain documentation of control implementations and testing results for audit purposes.

- **Monitoring Program**
  * Conduct regular control testing to ensure compliance with SOC 2 criteria.
  * Use an issue tracking system to document and resolve identified gaps.
  * Monitor performance metrics to evaluate control effectiveness over time.
  * Develop improvement plans based on testing and audit findings.

### 3. Documentation Requirements
- **Policy Framework**
  * **Documentation Standards**: Define clear standards for documenting policies and procedures.
  * **Review Frequency**: Update policies at least annually or after major organizational changes.
  * **Distribution Methods**: Make policies accessible to all employees via a centralized repository.
  * **Training Requirements**: Provide training to ensure employees understand and follow documented policies.

- **Procedures Documentation**
  * Maintain detailed operating procedures for all key processes.
  * Develop work instructions to guide employees in specific tasks.
  * Create technical guides for system configurations and troubleshooting.
  * Include training materials to support onboarding and continuous learning.
