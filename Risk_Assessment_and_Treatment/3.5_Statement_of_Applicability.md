# Statement of Applicability

The Statement of Applicability (SoA) for SafeHaven Cybersecurity’s Information Security Management System (ISMS) outlines the controls and measures applied to manage and mitigate risks effectively. This document highlights the applicable controls, the rationale for their inclusion or exclusion, and their alignment with organizational objectives and compliance requirements.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Statement of Applicability is to define the specific security controls selected to address identified risks in SafeHaven’s environment. It serves as a reference for the implementation and monitoring of controls, ensuring consistency in risk management and alignment with regulatory requirements such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and FFIEC.

## Scope

This SoA applies to all departments, processes, and information systems within SafeHaven Cybersecurity that handle sensitive data. It includes controls relevant to:

- **Data Security**: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data.
- **Access Control**: Managing and restricting access to systems and information.
- **Incident Response**: Detecting and responding to security incidents effectively.
- **Business Continuity**: Maintaining operations during disruptions and ensuring quick recovery.
- **Compliance**: Adhering to industry standards and regulatory requirements.

## Control Selection Criteria

Controls included in this SoA are selected based on:

- **Risk Assessments**: Controls are chosen based on identified risks from regular assessments, including potential threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Compliance obligations dictate the inclusion of specific controls to protect sensitive data.
- **Business Objectives**: Controls that align with organizational goals and support SafeHaven’s commitment to protecting its clients’ data and reputation.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Controls are evaluated for effectiveness and efficiency, balancing security needs with resource constraints.

## Applicable Controls

The following table provides a summary of selected controls and their application within SafeHaven Cybersecurity’s ISMS:

| Control Category            | Control                            | Description                                                                                          | Rationale for Inclusion                 |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Access Control**          | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  | Restricts access based on roles, ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive information.     | Minimizes unauthorized data access.     |
| **Data Encryption**         | Encryption at Rest and Transit    | Encrypts data stored on servers and transmitted over networks, protecting sensitive data from exposure. | Enhances data confidentiality and compliance. |
| **Incident Response**       | Incident Response Plan            | Establishes a structured process for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents. | Ensures prompt response to threats.     |
| **Physical Security**       | Facility Access Controls          | Restricts physical access to data centers and offices, limiting exposure to unauthorized individuals. | Protects hardware and sensitive data.   |
| **Logging and Monitoring**  | Continuous Security Monitoring    | Real-time monitoring of network traffic, logs, and user activities to detect anomalies and breaches.  | Enhances threat detection capabilities. |
| **Business Continuity**     | Backup and Disaster Recovery      | Regular data backups and recovery procedures to maintain data availability during disruptions.        | Supports operational resilience.        |
| **Compliance and Auditing** | Regular Compliance Audits         | Conducts audits to verify compliance with HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and other regulatory standards.      | Ensures ongoing adherence to standards. |

## Excluded Controls

Certain controls may be excluded from SafeHaven’s ISMS based on specific criteria:

- **Not Applicable to Operations**: Controls that are irrelevant to SafeHaven’s operations, such as those applicable only to manufacturing environments.
- **Alternative Controls in Place**: Where equivalent or compensating controls achieve the same objective without direct implementation of a standard control.
- **Resource Constraints**: In cases where the cost of implementing a control significantly outweighs the risk reduction benefit.

### List of Excluded Controls (Examples)

| Control Category     | Control                  | Reason for Exclusion                                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network Security** | IPS/IDS in Non-Critical Segments | IPS/IDS systems are implemented only in critical segments due to cost considerations.                |
| **Data Masking**     | Masking for Public Data  | Data masking is not applied to public or non-sensitive information as it does not pose a high risk.  |

## Monitoring and Review

The controls outlined in this Statement of Applicability are monitored and reviewed regularly to ensure they remain effective and relevant. Changes in business operations, risk environment, or regulatory requirements may necessitate adjustments to selected controls.

- **Quarterly Review**: A quarterly assessment to verify that controls meet current organizational needs and regulatory updates.
- **Annual Audit**: A comprehensive annual audit to validate control effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
- **Incident-Based Review**: Controls are reviewed and updated following any security incident to address gaps and strengthen defense mechanisms.

## Document Control

- **Effective Date**: [Insert Date]
- **Review Date**: [Insert Date]
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Owner**: ISMS Manager
