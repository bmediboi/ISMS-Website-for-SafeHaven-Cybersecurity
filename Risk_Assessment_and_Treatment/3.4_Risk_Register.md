## Part 1: Risk Treatment Strategy

### Executive Summary
This document outlines SafeHaven's comprehensive approach to cybersecurity risk management, combining risk treatment strategies with a detailed risk register. The framework aligns with ISO 27001 standards and industry best practices.

### Risk Assessment Methodology

#### Risk Evaluation Matrix
```
Impact Levels:
- Critical (5): Severe business impact, significant financial loss
- Major (4): Major business impact, substantial financial loss
- Moderate (3): Moderate impact on business operations
- Minor (2): Minor impact, easily recoverable
- Negligible (1): Minimal or no impact

Likelihood Levels:
- Almost Certain (5): >90% probability
- Likely (4): 60-90% probability
- Possible (3): 30-60% probability
- Unlikely (2): 10-30% probability
- Rare (1): <10% probability

Risk Rating = Impact Ã— Likelihood
- Severe: 20-25
- High: 15-19
- Medium: 10-14
- Low: 5-9
- Very Low: 1-4
```

#### Treatment Options
1. **Avoid**: Eliminate risk by removing source
2. **Mitigate**: Implement controls to reduce impact/likelihood
3. **Transfer**: Share risk through insurance/third parties
4. **Accept**: Monitor acceptable risks within tolerance

### Implementation Framework

#### Governance Structure
- Board oversight
- Risk management committee
- Security operations team
- Incident response team
