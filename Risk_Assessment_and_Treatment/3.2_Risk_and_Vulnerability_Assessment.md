# Risk and Vulnerability Assessment

## 1. Overview

The Risk and Vulnerability Assessment document defines SafeHaven’s approach to identifying, assessing, and managing risks and vulnerabilities across its information systems and operations. This process helps SafeHaven proactively protect its assets, ensure regulatory compliance, and maintain operational continuity.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized approach for conducting risk and vulnerability assessments. By following this approach, SafeHaven aims to identify potential threats, evaluate their impact, and implement measures to mitigate or manage the associated risks and vulnerabilities.

## 3. Scope

This assessment applies to all SafeHaven information assets, including:
- **IT Infrastructure**: Servers, networks, and workstations.
- **Data Assets**: Client data, proprietary information, and documentation.
- **Applications**: Software, web applications, and databases.
- **Personnel**: Employee access, roles, and security awareness.

## 4. Risk and Vulnerability Assessment Process

SafeHaven’s risk and vulnerability assessment process includes the following steps:

### 4.1 Risk Identification
- **Objective**: Identify potential risks that could impact SafeHaven’s operations, data security, or compliance.
- **Process**:
  - Identify risks across various areas, including IT infrastructure, data handling, and third-party relationships.
  - Record each risk in the Risk Register with a description, category, and potential impact.

### 4.2 Vulnerability Identification
- **Objective**: Detect vulnerabilities that could expose SafeHaven’s systems to exploitation.
- **Process**:
  - Use vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., Nessus, Qualys) to identify weaknesses in the network, applications, and infrastructure.
  - Conduct manual reviews to complement automated scans, especially for high-risk areas.
  - Document identified vulnerabilities in the Vulnerability Register with descriptions and severity levels.

### 4.3 Risk Analysis
- **Objective**: Assess the likelihood and potential impact of each identified risk.
- **Process**:
  - Use a qualitative or quantitative risk analysis method to assess each risk's likelihood and impact.
  - Prioritize risks based on factors like likelihood, impact, and affected asset value.
  - Assign risk levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low) based on the combined likelihood and impact scores.

### 4.4 Vulnerability Analysis
- **Objective**: Evaluate the impact of identified vulnerabilities on SafeHaven’s systems and data.
- **Process**:
  - Analyze vulnerabilities based on exploitability, affected assets, and potential business impact.
  - Prioritize vulnerabilities by severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) using CVSS scores or internal criteria.
  - Determine the urgency for remediation based on the vulnerability’s threat level and potential consequences.

### 4.5 Risk Treatment and Mitigation
- **Objective**: Develop and implement plans to address identified risks and vulnerabilities.
- **Process**:
  - Define a treatment plan for each risk, which may include mitigation, transfer, acceptance, or avoidance.
  - Apply patches, configuration changes, or other controls to address high-priority vulnerabilities.
  - Monitor risks that are accepted but require periodic review.

### 4.6 Monitoring and Reassessment
- **Objective**: Continuously monitor and review risks and vulnerabilities.
- **Process**:
  - Conduct regular assessments to update risk and vulnerability statuses.
  - Review the effectiveness of implemented controls and modify them as needed.
  - Perform re-assessments in response to significant organizational or technological changes.

## 5. Risk and Vulnerability Registers

SafeHaven maintains dedicated registers for tracking risks and vulnerabilities:

### Risk Register
- **Risk ID**: Unique identifier for each risk.
- **Description**: Brief description of the risk.
- **Impact Level**: High, Medium, or Low.
- **Likelihood**: Probability of occurrence.
- **Mitigation Plan**: Steps to address the risk.
- **Status**: Open, In Progress, Mitigated, or Accepted.

### Vulnerability Register
- **Vulnerability ID**: Unique identifier for each vulnerability.
- **Description**: Brief summary of the vulnerability.
- **Severity Level**: Critical, High, Medium, or Low.
- **Mitigation Plan**: Steps to address the vulnerability.
- **Status**: Open, In Progress, Resolved, or Accepted.

The Risk and Vulnerability Registers are reviewed quarterly to ensure accurate tracking and effective risk management.
